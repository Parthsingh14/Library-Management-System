# Library-Management-System
A full-stack web application built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) to demonstrate user and admin authentication, as well as database integration. 
This project was created as part of a hiring process, and while I could not complete all planned features due to time constraints, it showcases my skills in backend development, database design, and secure authentication mechanisms.

🚀 Completed Features
User Login System: Secure login functionality for users.
Admin Login System: Separate login and access for admin users.
Database Integration: MongoDB used to store user and admin details securely.
Password Security: Passwords hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.
Environment Variables: Sensitive data handled securely using dotenv.

❗ Planned Features
Due to limited time, I could not complete the following features, which were part of the initial plan:
Dashboard Features: Full-fledged dashboards for both users and admins to manage their activities.
Book Management System: Adding, editing, and deleting books in the library.
Borrowing System: Functionality to borrow and return books, with due date tracking.
Advanced Role Management: More robust user roles like librarians.
Deployment: Hosting the project online for easy access.

🌟 Why This Project Matters
While I couldn't complete the full scope of this project, it highlights my skills in:
Building secure authentication systems.
Managing backend development with Node.js and Express.
Working with MongoDB for database design and integration.
Structuring code for scalability and maintainability.


🙏 A Note to the Recruiter
